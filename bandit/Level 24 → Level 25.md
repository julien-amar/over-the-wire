# Level 24 â†’ Level 25

## Level Goal
A daemon is listening on `port 30002` and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode.  
There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

## Solution

Connect to the challenge through SSH:

```sh
~$ ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 # password: VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar
```

Generate a dictionary (in `/tmp/bandit24-brute-force.dic`) of all permittation we will send to the server:

```sh
bandit24@bandit:~$ CURRENT_PASSWORD=`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24`
bandit24@bandit:~$ for i in {0000..9999}; do echo $CURRENT_PASSWORD $i >> /tmp/bandit24-brute-force.dic; done
```

Send all dictionary entries, to the server:

```sh
bandit24@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/bandit24-brute-force.dic | nc localhost 30002
